LIFX plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

A plugin that automatically adds Lifx bulbs on the network to the Homebridge instead of tediously registering the lights individually via homekit.

Individual lights can be added manually.


This plugin will be updated regularly in the future, because I see it as a small heart task and use it personally. 

The reason to create this plugin was the use of several published already existing lifx-plugins for homebridge and the anger struggeling with lifx and homekit. Unfortunately, all the plugins I tested slowed down homebridge so I couldn't access my devices from outside my network.
This plugin should fix that problem and add some extra functionality

Also, lights that were not connected to the power were marked as "not responding".
This plugin automatically sets the status of these lights to offline as soon as the light can no longer be reached.

I appreciate anyone who would like to use my plugin and welcome comments of any kind.

Of course, sometimes no error is left out, so forgive me if you might have problems and stay tuned. Updates will follow as soon as possible!


## üöÄ Quick Start

 ### 1. **Installation**

npm i homebridge-lifx-plugin
```

Options can be found under [Settings](#‚öôÔ∏è-settings)

### 3. **Enjoy** üòéüí°

All Lifx bulbs accessible on the network will be added to your homekit automatically.
So go outside, configure your lights, create scenes and automations. Enjoy your lifeüßò

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
### General

|Title                  |Name    |Type       |Value         |Default|Description
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|---|-----------
|Platform Name          |`name`  |`string`   |any   |"Lifx Plugin"|Display name of the platform, to be seen in the log
|Enable Auto Discover   |`autoDiscover`  |`boolean`  |true/false    |true|Discovers bulbs by broadcasting
|Duration               |`duration`  |`integer`  |0...‚àû       |0|Time to fade on/off in milliseconds
|Brightness Duration    |`brightnessDuration`  |`integer`  |0...‚àû       |300|Time to fade in milliseconds for changing brightness
|Color Duration         |`colorDuration`  |`integer`  |0...‚àû       |300|Time to fade in milliseconds for changing color

### Bulbs

Adding bulbs separately is useful for networks where broadcasting is not possible or if you do not want the plugin to discover all bulbs automatically.
If autoDiscover is enabled the separately added bulbs are not added a second time.

|Title                  |Name    |Type       |Value         |Default|Description
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|---|-----------
|Name          |`name`  |`string`   |any   ||Name for recognizing the bulb
|Address   |`address`  |`string`  |ip    ||IP address of the bulb to be added separately
### Excludes

You can now create exceptions for your bulbs that should not be registered with broadcasting

|Title                  |Name    |Type       |Value         |Default|Description
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|---|-----------
|Name          |`name`  |`string`   |any   ||Name for recognizing the bulb
|Address   |`address`  |`string`  |ip    ||IP address of the bulb to be excluded
|ID   |`id`  |`string`  |id    ||Serial number of the bulb to be excluded

### Advenced Settings

|Broadcast Address          |`broadcast`  |`string`   |ip|255.255.255.255   |Broadcast address of your network to detect bulbs automatically

|Resend Packet Delay    |`resendPacketDelay`  |`integer`  |50...‚àû       |150|Delay between packages if light did not receive a packet
|Resend Packet Max Times         |`resendMaxTimes`  |`integer`  |0...‚àû       |3|Resend packages x times if light did not receive a packet
|Update         |`updates`  |`boolean`  |true/false       |true|Disable if you don't want the plugin to check for updates

### Example Configuration

## üß∞ Trouble Shooting
   
   ### Auto discover doesn't work
   If your devices aren't automatically discovered, you may have to change your `Broadcast Address` (see Advanced Settings). To find your broadcast address, open the terminal in Homebridge, e.g. https://homebridge.local/platform-tools/terminal, and run the command `ifconfig`. Look for the line `inet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx broadcast 255.255.255.255` and the value for `broadcast` should be used in your configuration. Note that the interface that's connected to your network, e.g. wifi or ethernet, will have the correct broadcast address.
